# Books
Akeen's Book Code Repository

## What is this
Repository containing all the ( hopefully runnable ) code from books I read

## Current Book
Test Driven Development: By Example - Kent Beck

### Note on code
Mainly gonna follow three rules
- Code should be easily runnable  & have tests when applicable
- Unless the book specifies otherwise the language I'll use is - *Java* ( subject to change )
- I'll only use neovim with a custom config.
